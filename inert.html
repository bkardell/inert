    <h1>What even is this?</h1>
    <p>The HTML spec contains a definition of a concept called 'inert'.  An 'inert' element is temporarily non-interactive - that is, you cannot focus it with the tab key, you cannot focus it with the mouse, and screen readers can't see it.  When an element is 'inert' its entire subtree is also inert. Several existing UI metaphors rely on making something temporarily inert - for example: a dialog makes everything else inert, a coverflow style interface would make the contents of the non-selected items inert - they're visible but you don't want them in the tab order or showing up to a screen reader - a stack or deck which paints things on top of one another might be the same issue.  In any case, it's hard managing all of this and so there are efforts to find some better accessibility primitives and easier sugar for defining things.  This is an experiment along those lines.</p>
    <h2>Explainer</h2>
    <p><code>inert</code> is a state of being that any element can be in, but it is initiated by an <code>inert-container</code>.  For purposes of forward compatibility and experimentation, there are two methods on document <code>document.inertify(element)</code> and <code>document.deinertify(element)</code>.  Calling one of these methods makes that passed element an <code>inert-container</code>, or not.  There is also an exposed getter on <code>HTMLElement.prototype.isInert</code> which will tell you if that code is in an <code>inert</code> state regarless of whether it, itself, is an <code>inert-container</code>.  It has a corresponding setter as well which has the same effect as calling <code>document.inertify(element)</code> or <code>document.inertify(element)</code> with that element (simply because I'm not sure what's better).  Setting the <code>inert-container</code> attribute (or removing it) has a similar effect as well.  Why?  Because I really have no idea what the best way to use this feature is :)</p>
